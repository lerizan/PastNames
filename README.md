# PastNames

PastNames is a lightweight Fabric client-side mod that allows you to view a player's previous Minecraft usernames.

## Features
- /pastname <name | uuid>
- Displays full username history
- Hover over names to see when they were changed
- Action bar feedback messages
- Fast Mojang API lookup with local cache

## Notes
- Looking up old usernames only works if the player was previously cached
  (Mojang API limitation).

## Platform
- Fabric (Client-side)

## API
If you have a premium API, I suggest you change it.
